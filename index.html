What am I going to do with my degree? However the stress does not go away after you graduate. In fact, the debt accumulated from college can cause many students and families to struggle financially, especially for low-income and minority families. Being current college students ourselves we have decided to research the cause and effects of student debt and how it can/will impact our futures. Because we now know first-hand how expensive secondary education is, we considered the financial aids offered to us via FAFSA and scholarships. But how do financial aids and access to such resources differ from demographic to demographic? Which demographics, if any, are positively or negatively affected?</p>

                <div class="container"><p>College is an important milestone for many Americans. It’s a higher education in which one achieves a degree in an area of study that will hopefully increase their chances of getting a job in a field that they’re interested in. According to US News, in-state tuition at national public universities has risen 175% and out-of-state tuition has risen 141% just over the past 20 years. With the expense of college tuition becoming a much more prevalent issue in households of high school graduates, the stress of applying for scholarships and grants can be immense; however, some have to worry more than others. People of color are at more of a disadvantage for accumulating student debt than any other secondary education-seeking demographic. The wealth gap - the financial gap between what is earned post-graduation and what is spent paying for further education - is significantly wider for black people than any other demographic. How can we ensure that students of color don’t get shut out of higher education completely?</div>

                                    <p class="mb-4"> In the article “An Analysis of the Student Loan Debt Crisis in the United States: The Causes, the Current Status, and the Future of Indebted Students” the authors went on to expose the causes and effects of student loan debt. One of their main pieces of evidence was the Higher Education Act and how it has affected the current status of this debt crisis. What readers can learn from this article is that the HEA was created in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson, and the goal of this act was to provide grants/loans for low income families. The HEA was the perfect way to allow any student to go anywhere they wanted to go for school despite their families income. At first both political parties agreed to this act and had very little conflict over it, this was until the Financial crisis in 2007-2009. This crash in the economy caused low unemployment rates which led to states cutting money flow to education and these unfortunate series of events caused a difference in opinion on the HEA. Ever since the HEA the amount of loans/grants borrowed has had a drastic increase causing most of the debt to fall on low-income and minority families. The article supports this by stating “Black students accumulated a heavier debt burden at each type of institution… Over 38% of Black students owe $59,050 or more” (Bynoe, 59), this also explains why many black and hispanics students are forced to drop out because of their debt rates being much higher than white students. Since the financial crisis in 2007 student debt has risen to $1.34 trillion as of 2017. This debt has created many problems for students of any ethnicity, such as difficulty affording housing after graduation, families of students constrict their financial resources, and much more as stated in the article; “Students with debt experience have lower job satisfaction when initially entering the workforce”(Bynoe,58). However while the HEA had good intentions, the unfortunate crash in the economy has put many graduates in, what seems to be, a continuous and heavy debt, especially minorities and low-income students.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The article “Student Debt and Hardship: Evidence from a Large Sample of Low- and Moderate-Income Households” focuses on the hardships associated with student debt and who is likely to experience them. Around 70% of students in the US borrow loans to assist with the cost of obtaining their degree, so it’s no surprise that this issue is extremely prevalent. These students who pursue a four year degree carry “an average debt burden of $28,950,”(Despard et al.) and that number is increasing every year. A survey by Children and Youth Services Review in November 2016 helps show the groups who are vulnerable to hardship and increased debt after borrowing loans. In a sample size of 5558, 61.16% had student debt. The people most likely to be affected by student debt include African-Americans, single people, people with more adults in the household, people with dependents, and people with a college degree. Of those surveyed, black people were 15% more likely to have student debt and face financial difficulty in the future. The survey also concluded that the majority of people who were able to pay off the loans were “younger, less likely to be Black or to have dependents, more likely to be employed or have health insurance, and had higher levels of education”(Despard et al).  </p>

                                    < The Article “The Price of Access: Graduate Student Debt for Students of Color 2000 to 2016”, explains how over these years the debt for students of color has been exponentially more than other students. They also explain how economic inequality is a primary factor in all of this too. Black/African American and Hispanic students in graduate and professional programs are disproportionately affected by educational debt. Studies show that Black/African American and Hispanic graduate students borrowed more than students of other races and experienced the largest percentage in borrowing from 2000 to 2016. There should be implications that include opportunities for enrollment without creating this huge amount of debt for people of color. This unfortunately does not stop at debt either but transitions to earnings in the workplace as well. According to a recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the typical U.S. White family has eight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times that of the typical Hispanic family. This article goes on further to discuss the level of borrowing among graduate students by race/ethnicity, how educational borrowing differs by race/ethnicity across degree programs and how it differs across institution sectors. It becomes clear that from the years 2000 to 2016 these people of color struggled the most in terms of student loan debt.>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Education is an opportunity many seek but cannot easily afford. This results in students facing sub-optimal financial decisions like taking out loans to pay tuition. There are obvious differences in racial treatment that makes this process referred to as predatory inclusion. Loans are offered but come with exploitative terms which in turn limit/eliminate their long term benefits. Student incomes have no chance against the rising prices of education. Especially with (usually) on-campus jobs containing low wages and incompatible schedules. It does not help that the Federal Financial Student Aid System fails to address certain issues when deciding where to allocate scholarship money. The assumption is made by FAFSA that most parents help out their child with paying for college. Therefore, this system uses means-testing to distribute money to “deserving” low-income students. Students and families, seeing no other option than to accept the terms that come along with loans, take this path which in widespread leads to the normalization of debt. The Pell Grant only helps so many, as a large number of families live on the edge of the middle class but still face significant financial hardship, but do not even qualify for the grant. Altogether, these issues have led to “intergenerational consequences” of a shift in the valuation of higher education. What the government must do is switch the administrative burden from the individual to the state. Debt forgiveness must play another factor in this process, even if only partial. This will put right past mistakes, and reinstate trust and well-being in education.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The article, “Black-White Disparity in Student Loan Debt More than Triples after Graduation” goes in depth on exactly how different student loan debt can be between different racial groups. Student loan debt, at least one would think, should be evenly dispersed among people regardless of race, but this article proves that it is far from even. Students of color, according to a U.S. Department of Education report, are, “more likely to take on student debt”. The article goes on to show how disproportionately minority students are affected by student loan debt, as opposed to white students. Student loan debt has grown exponentially over the past decades, but the racial disparity has grown just as much, if not more. “Four years after earning a bachelor’s degree, black graduates in the 2008 cohort held $24,720 more student loan debt than white graduates (52,726 versus $28,006) on average”. There is also a greater chance of loan defaulting for minorities as opposed to whites. For example, “black borrowers remain more than three times as likely to default within four years as white borrowers (7.6 percent versus 2.4 percent)”. Disparities in student debt for minorities has always been an issue, and will continue to grow exponentially until something is done about it. </p>
